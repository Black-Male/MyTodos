# MyTodos
My todos is a simple react/ruby project which allows users to create a todo list. It uses sinatra for backend allowing us to create a simple CRUD app. The project has a register page where one registers as a user and can then be selected from the dropdown list in the page.

# Starting the project
To start this project, copy the link in the about section of this repository and fork it. Clone the repository into your local environment by doing git clone ["link"].

The next step would be to open the cloned repo in your text editor and to run [bundle install] and then run  [bundle exec rake server] so that the server will be able to fetch the data required. Everytime data is edited on the server from the front end a notification pops up on the screen requesting a refresh of the page, please follow this instruction.
